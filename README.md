# dotfiles

This is my environment. There are two dependencies:

- [brew](https://brew.sh/)
- [nix](https://nixos.org/download/) (single-user)

Initial setup is a bit awkward as this is somewhat self-referential. Homebrew
and Nix need to be not only installed but also activated, which is done through
zshrc, which is managed by this repo.

I'll see if I can record the steps next time I set up a new machine.
